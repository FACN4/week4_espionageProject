# week4_espionageProject

## website: http://cities-of-the-world.herokuapp.com/

### Project Brief

- A website that enables users to quickly find and select words from a list of suggestions, as they type.
- The list is dynamically generated from a pre-populated list of values (i.e. a dictionary file), leveraging searching and filtering.
- A large data file is required to search through - consider the best data structure for this (e.g. .txt or .json).
- Consider how implementation affects user experience and web performance (e.g. time to load and search through the data file).

### User Story

- A website where the user can search for images of cities from around the world.
- Must be simple, easy to use, with a great UI.

### Goals

- [x] We expect back-end testing using tape (test as many components as you can) and basic front-end testing. Please note that we expect tests on pure functions and not on the router.

* [x] Host your project on heroku, see resource.

* [x] Use module.exports and require to break a single large server file into smaller modules.

* [x] Consider what would be a good server file structure based on what we have discussed over the week.
